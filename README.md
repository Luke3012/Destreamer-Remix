# Destreamer Remix

Destreamer Remix is a straightforward C# graphical interface built on top of the original **Destreamer** tool.  
Its purpose was to make downloading videos from Microsoft Stream easier, back when the service was fully operational.

Originally developed during the COVID-19 pandemic for remote learning, it simplified saving lecture and class videos for offline study — avoiding the hassle of command-line usage.

## Features

- **GUI for Destreamer:** Run downloads without needing the command-line.
- **Microsoft Stream Support:** Download videos directly from Microsoft Stream (while the service was active).
- **Offline Study:** Save lectures locally for later viewing.
- **Lightweight & Simple:** Minimal setup, straightforward workflow.

## Requirements

- Windows operating system.
- .NET Framework compatible with your system.
- Destreamer (original project) dependencies installed.
- Valid Microsoft account access to the videos.

## How It Works

Destreamer Remix wraps the command-line tool **Destreamer** with a clean, simple user interface.  
You paste the video link, provide your credentials if needed, and the program handles the rest.

## Limitations

- Works only when Microsoft Stream (classic) is available and accessible.
- Dependent on the original Destreamer’s capabilities and limitations.
- Not designed for high customization or automation.
